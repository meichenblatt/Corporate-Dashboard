## Corporate dashboard App

This corporate dashboard application uses AngularJS. There are three views; a geospatial view, a key metrics view and a dataview. 

This is my submission for project #4 in the Senior Web Development Nanodegree by Udacity. 

I used Gulp as the build process.

## Getting Started

In the root directory of the app run:

```
$ npm install
```

For developer mode:

```
$ gulp
```

For production mode:

```
$ gulp serve:dist
```

Enjoy!
